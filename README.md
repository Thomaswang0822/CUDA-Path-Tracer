# CUDA Path Tracer

## Quick Intro

This project serves to:

1. refresh my memory on path tracing and related techniques;
2. gain more insight on shipping a path tracer to GPU;

It is forked from the starter code of [**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Project 3**](https://github.com/CIS565-Fall-2022/Project3-CUDA-Path-Tracer), and will not be submitted as any schoolwork.

## Primary Reference

Since I have learned and (painfully) debugged those low-level interfaces in a past class project, it's more efficient to use someone else's code.

The primary reference code I used is by [@HummaWhite](https://github.com/CIS565-Fall-2023/Project3-CUDA-Path-Tracer).

For code irrelevant to CUDA, I mostly copy after understanding them. For CUDA-related code, I spent more time worship the technical beauty.
The parallizable BVH is the biggest reason I picked this repo as my reference.
