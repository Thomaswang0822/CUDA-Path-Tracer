# CUDA Path Tracer

This project serves to:

1. refresh my memory on path tracing and related techniques;
2. gain more insight on shipping a path tracer to GPU;

It is forked from the starter code of [**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Project 3**](https://github.com/CIS565-Fall-2022/Project3-CUDA-Path-Tracer), and will not be submitted as any schoolwork.

The primary reference code I used is by [@HummaWhite](https://github.com/CIS565-Fall-2023/Project3-CUDA-Path-Tracer).
